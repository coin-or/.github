The COIN-OR organization on Github is an open source repository managed by the COIN-OR Foundation, Inc., a non-profit educational foundation. We are building an open-source community for operations research software in order to speed development and deployment of models, algorithms, and cutting-edge computational research, as well as provide a forum for peer review of software similar to that provided by archival journals for theoretical research.
